    <strong class="my-strong">Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run!</strong>
            The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
            Boggis, squat Bunce, 
            and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and
            his family surrounded. 
            What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just
            any fox â€“ Mr. Fox 
            would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever
            can save him now.
